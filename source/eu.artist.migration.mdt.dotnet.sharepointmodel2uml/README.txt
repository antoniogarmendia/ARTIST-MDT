SharePoint Model Discoverer, Version 0.1.0

==========================================

ABOUT
-----
The goal for this component is to implement the Part 1 of a 3-phase transformation chain, 
i.e., produce input for another phase in which the SP data model is going to be 
transformed to a Database Model (phase 2, Model Understanding), independently from a 
targeted platform, for it to be eventually forward engineered to an actual Database 
Schema (phase 3, Model Understanding).
