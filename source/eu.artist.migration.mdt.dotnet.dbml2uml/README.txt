DBML Discoverer, Version 0.3.0

=================================

ABOUT
-----
The goal of this component is to implement the first part of the overall migration chain, 
i.e. reverse engineer the data specification to a database model, independent from a 
targeted platform. 

The present discoverer component currently considers:
- As input: a DBML specification (in XML), representing a LINQ-to-SQL database model.
- As output: a UML model containing the profiled UML class diagram generated out of the 
input.
